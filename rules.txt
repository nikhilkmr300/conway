Rules for the Conway's Game of Life are as follows:
1. Live cell (+1) with < 2 live neighbours dies (underpopulation).
2. Live cell (+1) with 2 or 3 live neighbours lives (just right).
3. Live cell (+1) with > 3 live neighbours dies (overpopulation).
4. Dead cell (-1) with exactly 3 live neighbours becomes live (birth).

Neighborhood is defined as the Moore neighbourhood (closest 8 cells).
